Hi, I am Julia (she/her); I was born in Brazil but have lived in the UK for over half of my life.

Iâ€™m interested in creativity, cultural immersion and mindfulness. 

I aspire to become a software engineer and to create a social impact by developing software that contributes to reducing gaps in access to education.
